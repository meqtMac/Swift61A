# ``Swift61A Course Design``

what CS61A has to learn from and what are missing from CS61A
## Introduction to Swift and Swift61A Sharing


## Installation

## The basics

### Values
value: 

`let`, `var`, `Type` and literal

basice types: 
Int, 
- constant declartion
```swift
let intConstant = 10
let doubleConstant = 10.0
let str = "Swift61A"
```
- some basic values: Int, Float, Double, String, Character
```
Int, Double, String
```
- Type Annotation
- Automatic Type Inference
- variable declaration
- mutability

### Functions

functions need type annotation thus Types should be should before Functions

### Controls

how to implement functions

if, for, while statement

### Closures and Higher Order functions

- closure type annotation 
- closure Syntax
- closure as input ( higher order functions )
- closure as output
- closure that captures value
- closure inspector and logger example
- escaping functions

### lldb for debugging, frame and backtrace

### Function Examples (Lecture6)

### Function Abstraction??

### Recursions

### Tree Recursion

## Some Other Standard Library types

- Array
- Dictionary
- Set
- String

## Data Abstraction

### Structures
- storage
- methods
- compuated vairable

### Extension

### Enumerations
- cases
- enumerations with associated value
- switch syntax
- case match with value

- Optional Result
- Error Managerment


### Access Control
`private`
`internal`
`public`

### Modular and Swift Package Manager

## Coding Paradigm

### Protocol
- Extension to Protocol

### Generic
some and template

### After these two optionals, containers and collections sequences, iterators are avialable

### Collections

#### Array Review

#### Collection Review

### Sequence Functions, map, filters

### On design of Sequence: Iterator

## Reference Types

### Class and Reference Types
- class declaration
- reference type and it's influence on mutality
- Deintialize

### Closures are References

### Automatic Reference Counting

### Weak Reference and Memory Leak

### Copy on Write and Managed Buffer


## Special Topic: Efficiency

### Fib

### Dynamic Programming

### 

## Bonus: C Interop
