# Swift61A Code Example Guideline

## Target Management
if there is some code to refer to using swift repl use Lecture as a target, for code that to write directly in repl give an executableTarget of name `"Lecture\(LectureIndex)Demo"`, for code to evaluate in repl use `let _ = ` in `main.swift`; use `// MARK: comment` to seperate videos. 

when writing, I should first note the brief/important stuffs in [Outline.md], when code is needs, write to main.swift for the demo.
