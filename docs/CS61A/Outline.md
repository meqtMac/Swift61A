# Swift61A Video Content List

## WelCome

## Functions

## Control

## Higher-Order Functions

## Environments

## Iterators

### Iterators
iter, next

### Dictionary Iterations

### For Statement

### Built-in Iterator Functions
map, 

### Zip
impl palindrome

### Using Iterators
Code that processes an iteratiro makes raw assumption about the data itself.

Example: Casino Blackjack

## Objects

### Object-Oriented Programming

A method for organizing programs
- Extends data abstraction
- Bundles together information and related behavior

A metaphor for computation using distributed state
- Each **object** has its own local state
- Each object also knows to manage its own local state
- Iteract with an object using its **methods**
- Several objects may all be instances of a comman class
- Different classes may relate to each other
// in swift it's good time to introduce struct and protocol

### Class Statements
a bank, holder, account example

### Creating Instances

### Methods

dot syntax is like a function that pass it self.

## Attributes
time to talk about swift struct properties

### Method Calls
time to talk about swift method call

// ### Attribute Lookup

### Class Attirbutes
time to talk about swift static method

### Bound Methods

struct functions verse functions

### Attribute Assignment
property like function

## Inheritance
I should first omit this in swift and talking about protocol

### Object-Oriented Design
Object-oriented programming shines when we adopt the metaphor

**Inheritance and Composition**
**from this part, we know that enum should be taught before object-oriented design**

### Attribute Loopup Practice

### Multiple Inheritance

maybe here to have some thing to learn from rust programming language

## Representation

**maybe it's a good time to introduct literal in swift**

### String Interpolation

also string concatenation

### Polymorphic Functions

**interface** 
Objects interact by looking up attributes on each other (passing message)

### Special Method Names in Python

## Composition

### Linked List Structure

### Linked List Processing

Range, Map, Filter for Linked Lists

### Linked List Mutation

### Linked List Mutation Example

### Tree Class
Implement Tree in swift.

### Tree Mutation

### Understand and Imple copy on write your self.

## Efficiency/Benckmark

recursive computation of the fibonacci sequence

### Memorization
fib example

### Exponentiation
it would be great if I can draw time with swift to a graph

### Orders of Growth
- quadratic time
- tree-recursive functions can take exponential times
- Linear Growth
- Logarithmic growth
- Constant growth

### Order of Growth Notation

### Space
stack frames

## Decomposition

### Modular Design

Separation of Concerns

Function should know less about other parts

### Example: Restaurant Search

### Example: Similar Restaurants

### Example: Reading Files

### Set intersection

## Data Examples

### Examples: Lists

### Examples: Objects
```
class Bourgeoisie(Worker):
    greeting = "Peon"
    def work(self):
        print(Worker.work(self))
        return "I gather wealth"
```

### Examples: Iterables & Iterators

### Examples: Linked Lists
